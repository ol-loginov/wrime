==============================
Terms:
==============================

<call> - one invocation point (single function call, or chain of calls). For example:
  a.foo().bubba.getToken()
    it means "take var a, call a method 'foo' on it, then call method 'bubba' or getter 'getBubba' on result, then call 'getToken' method on it
  i18n:concat("a", a, "b")
    if you add token with ':' to the beginning of expression, then this means we use functor (class), registered in an engine

==============================
1-statements
==============================

${<call>} produces write to output or just call (if expression result is void)

==============================
Loop-statements:
==============================

${loop(a : <call>)} - start the for-each iteration. Type of a is deducted according to result for <call> (java.lang.Object in common)
${loop} - finish last opened for-each.

You may nest any reasonable number of loops

-------------------------

${break} - works like Java's "break"

-------------------------

${continue} - works like Java's "continue"

==============================
Parameter declaration
==============================

${param java.lang.String aaa} - this introduces parameter. It will be assigned from ModelMap input.

-------------------------

${param java.lang.String aaa transient} - this marks transient parameter. It will be automatically passed to underline calls to other child templates

==============================
Include other templates
==============================

${include "./asdasdasd.html"} - includes other template named "asdasdasd.html" in the same folder as current template
${include "../asdasdasd.html"} - includes other template named "asdasdasd.html" from parent folder
${include :concat("asdasd", someName, ".html")} - includes other template based on runtime info
